# zmk-config

This is my personal [ZMK firmware](https://github.com/zmkfirmware/zmk/)
configuration. It is used for my 42-key Corne build.

The main goal of the config is to find a 42-key layout that can accomodate the Nordic keys ```æ```,```ø```,```å``` and ```ð``` while still having easy and fast access to symbols used for programming.

Further sub-goals include:
- [x] Access to numbers in a numpad layout instead of in a row.
- [ ] Easy access to ```´``` in order to write characters such as ```á```, ```í```,```ú```,```ó``` and ```ý```.
- [ ] Installation of batteries in order to have true wireless capabilities.
  - [ ] Soldering on nice!view displays for battery monitoring.
